## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **yt-dlp**: This is a powerful command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other video sites.
    You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install yt-dlp
    ```

## üìù Script Descriptions

### `copy_paste.py`

This script is designed to **extract YouTube links from a WhatsApp chat export file**.

* It reads a file named `chats.txt` (which you should place in your Downloads folder).
* It identifies all YouTube links within the chat messages.
* Finally, it writes these extracted links to a new file named `yt_links.txt` in the same Downloads folder.
* **Important**: Currently, it only includes links starting with `https://youtube.com/`. Other link formats or messages are ignored.

### `download_yt_shorts.py`

This script automates the **downloading of YouTube videos** listed in the `yt_links.txt` file.

* It reads the list of YouTube links generated by `copy_paste.py` from `yt_links.txt` (located in your Downloads folder).
* It uses `yt-dlp` to download each video into a specified output directory (`yt_shorts` within your Downloads folder).
* To prevent redundant downloads, the script checks if a video (identified by its video ID) has already been downloaded and skips it if found.
* At the end of the process, it provides a summary showing the total links processed, successful downloads, skipped videos, and any failed downloads.

## üèÉ How to Run the Scripts

### Step 1: Prepare your WhatsApp Chat Export

1.  Export your WhatsApp chat as a text file.
2.  Rename the exported file to `chats.txt`.
3.  Place `chats.txt` in your **Downloads** folder (`C:\Users\HP\Downloads` by default).

### Step 2: Extract YouTube Links using `copy_paste.py`

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `copy_paste.py` (e.g., `cd path/to/your/youtube-shorts`).
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python copy_paste.py
    ```
    This will create `yt_links.txt` in your Downloads folder, containing all extracted YouTube links.

### Step 3: Download YouTube Videos using `download_yt_shorts.py`

1.  Ensure you have `yt_links.txt` in your Downloads folder (generated from Step 2).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `download_yt_shorts.py`.
4.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python download_yt_shorts.py
    ```
    The script will create a folder named `yt_shorts` in your Downloads directory (if it doesn't exist) and start downloading the videos there. You'll see progress updates and a final summary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Optional)

Both scripts are currently hardcoded to use specific paths:

* **Input File for `copy_paste.py`**: `C:\Users\HP\Downloads\chats.txt`
* **Output File for `copy_paste.py`**: `C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yt_links.txt`
* **Input File for `download_yt_shorts.py`**: `C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yt_links.txt`
* **Output Folder for `download_yt_shorts.py`**: `C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yt_shorts`

If you wish to change these paths, you'll need to directly edit the `file_path` and `output_folder` variables within `copy_paste.py` and `download_yt_shorts.py` respectively.
