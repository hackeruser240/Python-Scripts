üìú Scripts Overview
1. copy_paste.py
This script automates the process of extracting YouTube links from a WhatsApp chat export file. It's designed to parse through your chat history and identify all links that point to youtube.com.

What it does:

Reads a WhatsApp chat export file named chats.txt (expected in your Downloads folder).

Identifies and extracts all YouTube links (specifically those starting with https://youtube.com/).

Writes the extracted links, each on a new line, to a file named yt_links.txt in the same Downloads folder.

2. download_yt_shorts.py
This script takes the list of YouTube links generated by copy_paste.py and downloads the corresponding videos using yt-dlp. It's smart enough to skip videos that have already been downloaded.

What it does:

Reads YouTube links from yt_links.txt (expected in your Downloads folder).

Creates an output directory named yt_shorts within your Downloads folder if it doesn't already exist.

Downloads each video using yt-dlp.

Checks if a video has already been downloaded (based on its video ID in the filename) and skips it if found.

Prints a summary at the end, detailing the total links processed, successful downloads, skipped videos, and unavailable/failed downloads.

üöÄ How to Run the Scripts
Prerequisites
Before running these scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3:
If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org.

yt-dlp:
yt-dlp is a powerful command-line program for downloading videos from YouTube and other sites.
Install it using pip:

pip install yt-dlp

Or, for more detailed installation instructions, refer to the yt-dlp GitHub page.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Prepare Your WhatsApp Chat Export
Export your WhatsApp chat as a .txt file. Make sure to include media if you want to ensure all links are present.

Rename the exported file to chats.txt.

Place chats.txt in your system's Downloads folder (e.g., C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads on Windows).

Step 2: Extract YouTube Links (copy_paste.py)
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the youtube-shorts directory where you saved copy_paste.py.

Run the script:

python copy_paste.py

This will create a yt_links.txt file in your Downloads folder containing all extracted YouTube links.

Step 3: Download YouTube Videos (download_yt_shorts.py)
Ensure you have run copy_paste.py first, as download_yt_shorts.py relies on the yt_links.txt file.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the youtube-shorts directory.

Run the script:

python download_yt_shorts.py

This will start downloading the videos into a new folder named yt_shorts within your Downloads directory. The script will provide progress updates and a summary upon completion.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Optional)
Both scripts are configured to use the Downloads folder by default. If your chats.txt or desired output location is different, you can modify the downloads_dir, chat_file, yt_links_file, input_file, and output_folder variables directly within the Python scripts:

copy_paste.py
# File paths
downloads_dir = Path("C:/Users/HP/Downloads") # Change this if your Downloads path is different
chat_file = downloads_dir / "chats.txt"
yt_links_file = downloads_dir / "yt_links.txt"

download_yt_shorts.py
def main():
    input_file = r"C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yt_links.txt" # Change this if yt_links.txt is elsewhere
    output_folder = r"C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yt_shorts" # Change this to your desired output folder
    # ...

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
File Paths: The scripts are hardcoded to look for chats.txt and yt_links.txt in the Downloads folder and to create yt_shorts within it. Adjust the paths in the scripts if your setup differs.

yt-dlp: Ensure yt-dlp is correctly installed and accessible from your system's PATH. If you encounter issues, try running yt-dlp --version in your terminal to verify its installation.

WhatsApp Chat Format: The copy_paste.py script expects a standard WhatsApp chat export format. Variations in the export format might affect its ability to extract all links.

Error Handling: The download_yt_shorts.py script includes basic error handling for failed downloads and will skip videos that are already present.
